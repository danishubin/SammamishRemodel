            <div class="col-sm contact">Most architects will charge an hourly rate, and give a basic range of how much time they believe it will take them to draw, engineer, and submit for building permits. A typical range you should expect to pay is somewhere between $160/hr -
                $200/hr. </div>
            <div class="col-sm contact">Its typically best to have the architect who is drawing the plans also submit for the permits. They will have the most experience in a variety of jurisdictions, and will work with the city to properly fill out and submit the many documents
                required plan review and building permits. Typically costs for permits will end up running between 3% to 4% of the total cost of the project, and could potentially go up from there depending on several factors like cost to bond, environmental
                studies/reports, arborists costs, surveying costs, etc.</div>
            <div class="col-sm contact">
                <p>New construction will always have sitework/site prep that will need to be done prior to construction. Sitework can vary drastically depending on what is already done and what still needs to be done. For instance if you have raw land that
                    is heavily forested then site work will be a greater cost than if the land you own is already cleared, graded, and ready for a house.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Typical construction with fairly contractor grade finishes will cost somewhere between $430 to $500 per square foot and can go up from there. The more custom the home the more the cost. The challenge with keeping costs to a minimum is
                    usually when a homeowner building a new house wants the best of everything, so keeping within budget largely depends on the homeowner.
